## What is BrowseHand?

BrowseHand is a local browser automation agent based on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
It allows AI assistants like Claude to directly control your real Chrome browser — reading data, clicking, scrolling, and extracting information.

## Architecture

```
User/Claude → MCP Server (localhost:8765) ↔ Chrome Extension → Active Tab
```

The MCP server acts as a bridge between Claude Desktop and the Chrome Extension.
All communication happens **locally** — no data leaves your machine.
